# Arma 3 Operation Unending Storm(OpUs)

# What is OpUs?
Arma 3 OpUs was supposed to be a 200+ player, persistant, open-world, cross-server, war gamemode. But as for many other modders, lifeâ„¢ happened(for the better, but kinda sad to see this lagging behind). Many of the mechanics necessary for making it happen have been implemented, but its a solid few months of dedicated work away from being playable. There is currently no documentation for exactly how the various parts are interconnected, but if anyone finds this and would like to contribute then you can send me an email at opus.nbula@gmail.com if you want to merge something or get stuck somewhere, and ill try to respond.
I must say though that i check it very infrequently. I will most likely be continuing development on this every now and then, but cannot give any reliable release date anytime soon.

# Well that seems a bit ambitious... exactly how would this be possible?
There are a few documents explaining what is contained and what was planned(versionNotes.txt and GameModeOutlines) for the inquisitive, and if you feel like this is a wonderful idea going to waste then feel free to shoot me a an email about how you feel or even donate at Patreon(https://www.patreon.com/OpUs_Nebula) if you are in a giving mood.
