Hello! The following functions were mostly taken from BI Forums Scripting and Editing section,
with alterations for improved performance and/or expanded function. Links to their pages
are in the comment section above each script, Along with Credit towards who created it.
If someone who wrote any of the scripts found in this file reads this, then i send my personal
thanks for supplying it to the scripting community, and for saving me from a major headache due to
furious keyboard mashing using everything but my fingers.
