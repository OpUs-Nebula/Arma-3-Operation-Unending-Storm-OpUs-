v0.147
+RandomGeneration of ZoneMarkers implimented, based upon input of FlagPoleBorders (NW,SW,SE,NE) Order in editor vital

//DISGARD//
+- Zones Implimented!(YAYAYAYAYAYAY) borders still to be determined, should be rather simple. OBS! Use DefineZone function, needs occupying anyway.
//DISGARD//

+ Starter Markers shifted to independant, as they should
+ Rough ObjectiveSpawner template added, modular enough to be used for any house defined through presets.(UNFINISHED)
+ CompSQM included, in which triggers and objective templates are present, for use witch Extractor.
+- Working Trigger spawn added, issue revolving around use of execVM and parameters needs fixing(fn_DefineZones), bool works, not function(and/or call)///FIXED,DETAILS BELOW:///
//
Trigger Statements update variables used when launched, workaround uses needed variables stored within trigget text
through formating into string simpleArray, and parsing in statement when needed for ZoneGuardian call. DONT EVER use local variables, or 
global variables with dynamic values changed meant to be changed in each loop, and then store that certain value.
//
+ Nations defined for east, west and resistance. Marker color now retrived externally.
+ TriggerText now updates according to new force that occupies zone(Truly fixed, used to be restriced to sectors).
+ PostInit added for simplyfing of browsing and better order.
+ Preliminary timer for Zone Capture added, Lots of notes to review surrounding gamemode in respective files.

+ Lvl 0/Single Zones Added(Will probably function as native bases, in terms of difficulty. might add manually spawning objectives, and/or base configs.)
+ Timer and capture dependant on force of nation and duration added(Finalized, duration to be tweaked and objective requirement added.)
+ Timers deleted upon compleation 
+ Changed MissionName to OpUs(We're official, woho!) and a few tweaks to mission desc, revive etc.
+ Added framework for randomization of objective, commented out atm, to be implimented when Objectives are
Playable.
+ Objective unit groups now dependent on occup side, random selection.
+ Extractor pretty much complete, script sections to be added last, for added user friendliness, added with mission
+ SampleTXT with needed params, might need storing through missionConfig.
+ First Objective added via extractor framework, volume should be much easier to produce from now on
+ StratBuild for militairy office added, needs scripting for intel collection
+ Buildings now heal post Objective(More to come post config implimentation)
+ Zones can now be captured regardless of units already present.
+ Rough Intel framework added, All objective Population code turned into scripts, easy and modular application and tweaking across all objectives now.

v0.092
+ Territory added(Fucccin AYEEEEEE!)
Building of major constructions and facilities can only occur wihtin these. Including FOBs. if 1 is lost,
then remaining bases and or outposts will need to be used, cannot be rebuilt, but repaired. Camps can be
Constructed though, requires food for restoration of spawning power??

v0.095
+ FOB props now spawn properly, through function, not implimented ingame yet.
Units still not spawning though.

v0.097
+ Added AI management scripts(AiLoadout, BaseLoadout) dependant on predefined loadouts for each side
need an extractor like script for user input\streamlining though.

script that triggers along with value change, instead of constant checkup of value.

v0.098
+ Rough Extractor for Factories added
+ GUI for Engineering added, Vehicles factories Offsets added(VR enteties indicating Factory Spawns WIP)
+ AliveHandler fixed for props and invincible AI in bases.
+ sleep switched to uiSleep in zoneTimer and Guardian.(Where it is used for timekeeping and not rest in while
loops for system)
NOTE: Desc is still messed up, dubbleprints on some rows for some reason, Ex:

"...Arma 3 is a very good gam
game, it has an extre
extremly versitile..."

v0.100
+Camera and Build limit added(550 for cam, 500 for object. to vary depending on base level doe.)
+Slider for building direction added, crude spawn and cost implimented.

v0.101
+ Factory menu added, vehicles can now be spawned from them
(rought cfg rip atm, to be replaced with arrays including vehicle price, Nations who can buy them,
stockpile array etc.)
//NOTE ABOUT STOCKPILE//
Will most likely use a dedicated tab for stockpiled vehicles/weapons in engineering, and have them
delivered straight to garage.

v0.102
+AISkill now working properly
+Nation GDP and Player funds now displayed in appropriate menus
(GDP set to 0 for now, will need to get from extDB in future)

v0.105

can join infinetly many battles, but can start limited amount. 

v0.112
+ Bugfix to zone activation limitation
+ Rudemantary patrol/Zone garrison spawns implimented(Not fixed for high level zones yet)

v0.115
+ High Level zones patrol distribution added(ie they dont patrol entire zone, they all have sections to check)

v0.117
+ Rudemantary building tiers implimented, to add icons and functionality on each for increased awesomness
+ AOs and their power now registeres for nations, to hinder futher zones from being attacked beyond server set cap.
(To be switched from trigger ID to zones variable ID, for ease of check when 
determining if building can be repaired, or FOB/Base Constructed.)

v0.121

+ Territory stored as zones index instead of full coordinates in nation variables
+ BuildPop added(populates buildings in low level zones)
+ NationAOupdt added(Streamlined funktion for removing/adding territory after capture of zone)

v0.123

v0.131

+ Rough Outline for Arsenal management added, consideration for attachments and magazines already in weapons needed,
along with deletion or payment option for too many magazines/items added through arsenal(explosives,magazines)
Will most likely require locking of inventory for shop duration to stop players from backpack duping, or
removal of items until payment, instead of wait for payment.

v0.135
+ Arsenal added, Items and Weapons can be payed for or deleted if not already in arsenal variable
+ Restructuring of WeaponParams(Main formatting of outPut generalised outside of nation statements)
+ ConfigRip added
//Uses function for reasonable pricing/Adding of magazines for 
All weapons defined in WeaponParams, if mags are not already present in Common tier.

v0.137
+ Began major restructuring of Arsenal script, in order to take attachments and their placements into account,
along with where items that need paying for are to be redeposited, in order to prevent items disappearing due to
lack of space.
+Added forum script by larrow along with a few tweaks for adding/removing attachments for weapons in inventories, will
most likely be used for Crates/Vehicles aswell.
//NOTE REGARDING USE FOR VEHICLES// Will most likely require custom script, or addition of parameters,
that spawns agents on server boot, that are responsible for adding attachments to vehicles. might have 1 agent/item/vehicle.
will lead to major start lag, but will dissipate quickly and guarantee that nothing of value to players is lost.

v0.138
+ Attachments for weapons and their placements in containers(vest,uniform,backpack) now taken into account
in arsenal script, rought POC attachment delete script in place, to expand functionality for repurchase

item/Weapon Count.

v0.142

+ Setting of data has been completed for playerinfo, although string preparation is to be implimented.

v0.146
+ DB Data exchange should now be fully working, with dynamically scaling tables and columns.
(Note, Main issue was lack of preparation of strings, check for that if issues pop up later.)

v0.147
+ DB Issue with setting of data inside newly created tables/columns/rows now fixed
(Issue for playerinfo was inssuficent recognition/managment of null strings, now managed in DBS_fnc_EntryExists, which should
cure all related issues with worlds aswell.)
+ Funds, Loadout,Funds and Arsenal now fully persistant, updated on call of functions.
(Might use EHs for automation, but nice to have control over data flow if need for regulation arises)
+ Added wrapper functions for commmon DB operations (client_fnc_SaveFunds/SaveArsenal/SaveFunds etc)
