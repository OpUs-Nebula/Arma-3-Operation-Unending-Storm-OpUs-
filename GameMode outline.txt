FBuildings in towns can be converted into various factories\Utilities, such as barracks, ammo depots etc. Can be destroyed by
players, manual repair except when zone is under threat and\or has just been captured. Possibly HardMode where
auto-repair is not present, providing incentive for players to think twice about carpet bombing, and keep buildings
in good condition for objective spawn in favourable locations for added town protection.
Shop Building: for friendly factions to come along and buy arms, basic supplies etc. Option to setup arms expo
aswell. Default Nations only hold expos once a week for increased scarcity of NATO\CSAT armaments.

Dedicated Repurpose Vehicle,DRV, checks if nearby building is in friendly territory and if true, then if it is in
Array of Refurbishable factories. Most likely same system checking if already occupied, and if so, cutting down the cost to 1/4 or maybe even
just repair costs.

FOB levels:
1: barrack building
2: Cargo HQ
3: Cargo Tower

HQ = Militairy Offices

FOB level 3 can hold 5000 of each resource(5 stacks),
lvl 2 = 3000, lvl 1 = 1500.
1 stack per k, different stacks for 10k

(15.927 - 15.427) = Z offseat for seated cargo tower.

//Defence
Players can setup persistant Patrol Routes for Defending squads. Might add auto-repurchase aswell,
with timer of 24h until repurchase.

//Texture Editor
Textures to be edited most likely need to be included in description.ext, in order
to then be edited ingame. 

Planned resources:
Steel 5000
Wood 3000
Oil(fuel) 1000
//2 small tanks on 2, 1 small tank on 1.

//OTHER BUILDINGS
Gold 1000
Lead 2000
Uranium(depleted? Maybe i dunno, might be good for tanks)

//GROUP RELATED
Maximum group count per side: 36
if 144 players on 3 sides, it means
minimum of 4 players per group if full side/group count.
287 is hardcoded limit.

Will probably need a system for city ai joining common super group,
if group count is approaching hardcoded limit. Requires some sort of array
stored most likely in namespace, with all groups defending a given city.

//UI
Can use the same UI but ReWrite titles/Buttons in order to provide different functions and/or
buying options. Ex. Converting the current Engineering UI into Building purchase(By founder of Base, and/or commander)
Roads should be OK building sites(Why would you not be able to block roads!?!?!)
ListBox could be populated with buildings instead. Said buildings using the same ui but for vehicle purchase,
these purchases build specific vehicles in determined positions, for less issues with players accidentally messing 
up purchase location and blowing their well earned funds sky high.

Engineering Bars Categories will be populated with Factory Tab, base manegement tab etc,
Factory Tab puts all factories in ListBox, with distance in paranthesis, and mini-map showing position of factory.
Desc will show capabilites of Factory, along with Hand Written trivia.

//NOTE TO SELF REGARDING UI/VERTICAL SLICE INCOMPLETNESS//
Finish systems the way you intend them. Even thouth playable version will take longer, its better
if the mechanics are implimented the way you want them, instead of in a haphazard way that will only
be used in dev anyway. Do that in PoC Test Chamber. 

//Resources//
Mining:
if terrain object count of rocks is > 0, then mining can occur. Count of rocks , and if possible, size of them
will determine how effective the mining is. boundingBoxReal and boundingBox can be used for rough volume.
Frequency of rare metals increases aswell, necssary size of rocks for most rare metals should equate those 
found in quaries.

Oil:

Wood:
Pretty obvious, if object is tree, size determines amount of wood.

PlaceHolder resource shop: ION industries. Main Base located off Map on Oil rig, merchants scattered,
Mercs can be hired at merchants.

//Factories//
lowered production time for higher level buildings(maybe for amount being produced at once...?)
Vr holo vehicles showing SpawnPositions of vehicles and types(Would be fine AF) //ADDED BOIII//
use If in populable buildings, then spawn props script.

use ScreenToWorld for main buildings, modelToWorld to mainbuilding for all props and/or buildings related.

Factory Owner gets 10% of vehicle price(too high leads to exploit)

Dedicated StockPile building, where players can buy inter-nation traded weapons/arms. 
Commanders might get part of deal when doing arms deals.

UI cats:

Weapons
Vehicles
Gear

price then stock nr in box below, followed by description of vehicle.(rip from FANDOM wikia)


Categories in Land:
Un-Armored(Civ)

Light(Hunters, Ifrits, Striders)
Medium(Marshall, Gorgon, Marid)
Heavy(Slammer,Kuma,Varsuk)

Air:
Rotary
Fixed Wing
VTOL(Mebe, might just merge it)

Sea:
Transport
Combat

//Vehicle Storage//
Possibly repair included with some, not sure yet. probably not.

Large Dome:
all land vehicles

Small Dome:
Medium and smaller

workshop:
Light and smaller

//Experiance//
Ranks: 
Custom experiance, Determines what kind of bases and defences you can build(mebe?)

Perks: 
InfiniSprint(Infantry perk added after certain miles run)
GunSlinger(after buying guns for x amount of cash, or sold for x amount)
SF Operator(After x amount of covert missions and/or time spent as Spec Ops, lowers detectioncoefficient)

//Persistant Timers//
(Zones, Base Building, Vehicle orders(mebe, max 20 min for spawn though.)

Will most likely have to store in while loops in order to save values, with conditions that can insert
values for timers to resume mid-count.

//ZONES//
Commander inputed setVariable controlling the max size AO that can be attacked. Alternativly server set by admins. most likely
commander, to allow more autonomy to standalone nations.

Nation missionNamespace only contains zone indexes for owned zones, keeps it readable from ingame and no need for such amount of
data to be transfered for nothing. Removed and added when zone is lost/captured.

QRFs search entire zones, as to ensure no presence of enemy forces.

AAF needs to defend for equally long time before zone is recaptured
adds an KOTH style element to it, creates an atmosphere of fierce fights over zones, with freeroam for players where character progress made when
defending/attacking zones is felt when dealing with Patrols, Base invasions, setting up mining posts and other things around the teams territory, as better gear,
more tiers and therefore gear/vehicles to pick from, larger area to defend, but still with one central gameplay element everyone can focus on, if
necessary.


//WEAPONS AND ITEMS PURCHASE//
Armory:

Using DropDown menu, allows for infinite amount of Tiers. Will most likely do the same for vehicles.
//RifleMan is always base, unless configured otherwise in description settings.


Tiers:
RifleMan(1 slots, ARs up to 6.5mm, from 5.56)
AutoRifleman(1 slots, MX SW, Spar MG)
Marksman(1 slots, 7.62 up to 9.3 cyrus/.338 Mar-10)
AT(1 slots, Rocket launchers)
Heavy Gunner(2 slots, MMGs)
Sniper(2 slots, Full sniper rifles)
CrewMan(1 slot, Allows for flight suits, tank crew uniforms)
UAV operator(1 slot, Can use UAV terminal and control/Hack drones)
Medic(1 slot, Heals to 100% with MediKit, kan upgrade through leveling to FAKs, but revive with MediKit)

CrewMan benefits:
Flight Suits And Tank Crew uniforms provide additional funds when doing logistics missions,
More funds when conducting vehicle kills, More experiance for Ground Support class 

Arsenal functioning:
Checks currently equipped items and ammo,
waits until dialog is closed, checks for any changes and withdraws/Deposits cash/items that have changed.
Old items stored in armory, new items payed for. Impossible to go into debt, removes what ammo cant be payed for.

//INFANTRY CLASSES//
2 alternatives

1:
The system restricts what weaposn and gear can be bought/used. Must be AT to use Launchers, Sniper for Sniper rifles etc, with rifleman
weapons being used by all but the heaviest of specialists. AutoRifleman, Marksman and AT can use rifleman gear, but Heavy Gunner/Sniper can only use
class specific gear and Weaponry. Might use Right scrollBar of engineering menu to sort between weapons, uniforms etc.
Price,StockPile and Armory count displayed before description in lower left box.
Classes also gain benefits, such as increased carry weight(Stamina coefficient change) and decreased recoil(sniper > Marksmen, + added stealth)

Field-Medic(Can heal to 100% with FAKs)
Field-Surgeon(Can revive with FAKs)

Air Support(Cheaper Air vehicles, can only be used together with CrewMan)
Ground Support(Cheaper Land vehicles, can only be used together with CrewMan)


Fighter Pilot (even cheaper Air-Superiority vehicles, can only be used together with CrewMan)
CAS Pilot (even cheaper CAS vehicles, can only be used together with CrewMan)
Tank Commander (even cheaper Heavy Vehicles, can only be used together with CrewMan)
Logistics Czar (even Logistical vehicles, can only be used together with CrewMan)

and generic bonuses such as added funds/Tier XP for Class-Related Tiers, missions, tasks etc. 



 

//DONT UsE, MIGHT PROVIDE OPTION//2. Everyone can buy and use any weapon. But designated classes only gain buffers, such as decreased recoil or larger carry weight.

//Side Missions//
Go on Foot/Vehicle/Air Patrols in territory or around Bases for money, Random chance of AI spawned attack,
shows up on enemy sides as Ambush mission.

Random chance that patrol leads to Mining outpost, base or other enemy constructions/facilities/activity in territory, friendly or enemy.
